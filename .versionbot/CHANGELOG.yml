    - subject: Uses cert-manager for self-signed HTTPS certificates.
      hash: 89448e5aec28b7306e38d603970e971556d9a41f
      body: |
        This provides an example for how we can provision
        a self-signed certificate using cert-manager.  This
        is a kubernetes equivelent for our balena cert-manager
        which uses CFSSL.

        The kubernetes cert-manager seamlessly works with ingresses
        and is also capable of requesting and renewing certificates
        from LetsEncrypt.
