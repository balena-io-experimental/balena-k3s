      hash: 31dec09b2865b5aec685775ee05cff1bd945739f
      body: |
        The feature for automatic creation of an image pull secret for
        docker.io has been removed.

        Image pull secrets should now be defined as a kubernetes manifest
        included in the kustomization.  The instructions in the README
        have been updated to show how to add an image pull secret
        for Dockerhub.

    - subject: Uses cert-manager for self-signed HTTPS certificates.
      hash: 89448e5aec28b7306e38d603970e971556d9a41f
      body: |
        This provides an example for how we can provision
        a self-signed certificate using cert-manager.  This
        is a kubernetes equivelent for our balena cert-manager
        which uses CFSSL.

        The kubernetes cert-manager seamlessly works with ingresses
        and is also capable of requesting and renewing certificates
        from LetsEncrypt.
